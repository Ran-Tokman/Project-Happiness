# Project Happiness

What determines happiness? Can certain variables predict how happy a country is?

## Data

- Data is collected from Knoema's World Happiness Index for 2018, which sourced the original data from the World Happiness Report published by the Sustainable Development Solutions Network
- Surveying 156 countries, the report provides the rankings overall happiness amongst other life-evaluation question asked in the poll 
- Rankings are taken from nationally representative samples of ~1,000 respondents per country
- The happiness score is ranked on a scale of 1 to 10. Each variable measures a population-weighted average score on a scale from 0 to 10

The model aims to predict Happiness Score for a given country. The independent variables in the model consisted of the following by country:
- Positive Emotions
- Negative Emotions
- GDP per Capita
- Health/Life Expectancy
- Freedom
- Social Support
- Government Confidence
- Generosity
- Perception of Corruption

### Data Cleaning

- Organize the schema by pivoting the dataframe to make each country as the index, while rearranging each independent variable into its own column
- Dropping all other columns except for the selected independent variables
- Dropping all NaN values, which left the dataframe with 123 countries that have workable data
- Snippet of resulting dataframe:

## Initial Observations

- Strong positive correlations were observed between Happiness Score (dependent variable) with GDP per Capita, Health/Life Expectancy, and Social Support. Negative correlations with the dependent variable are shown for Negative Emotions and Perception of Corruption

There are some outliers detected for the variables Freedom, Social Support, Generosity, and Perception of Corruption. These outliers are kept in the dataset since eliminating them would mean excluding countries with geopolitical instabilities.

## Understanding the Target Variable

I wanted to see what the R<sup>2</sup> look like with all the original independent variables in the dataset:
- SKlearn gave me a baseline R<sup>2</sup> of 0.77
- OLS gave me an R<sup>2</sup> of 0.81
<img width="340" alt="Screen Shot 2019-04-18 at 2 23 45 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44821660/56382708-feb21700-61e5-11e9-8248-abe0ca0ab343.png">

### Checking for Multicollinearity

Multicollinearity is detected for GDP per Capita. However, given its high correlation with the dependent variable, I decide to keep it in the model. 
<img width="806" alt="Screen Shot 2019-04-18 at 2 29 06 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44821660/56382837-59e40980-61e6-11e9-9df5-ac6175e8b36e.png">

### Checking for Interaction

Given all possible combinations of independent variables, I find that Social Support is a major confounding variable. I decided to  split up Social Support into 3 categories: High Social Support Environment, Medium Social Support Environment, and Low Social Support Environment.
<img width="729" alt="Screen Shot 2019-04-18 at 2 31 46 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44821660/56383111-0b833a80-61e7-11e9-88a3-66245ab7fd49.png">

Out of the three independent variables that had the highest interactions with Social Support, Health/Life Expectancy and Perception of Corruption exhibit clear interaction with Happiness Score while Negative Emotions does not. To interpret this:
- The effect on Happiness Ccore are more strongly affected by level of Health/Life Expectancy in High Social Support environments than low social support environments
- The effect on Happiness Ccore are more strongly affected by Perception of Corruption in High Social Support environments than low social support environments

Given the above, I decide to include the two interactions in my model. 

### Checking for Non-Linearity 

Examining the relationships between Happiness Score and each independent variable more closely, there appears to be a non-linear relationship between Happiness Score with Health/Life Expectancy, Perception of Corruption:
<img width="792" alt="Screen Shot 2019-04-18 at 1 40 56 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44821660/56380228-a11acc00-61df-11e9-87df-f8093d32604a.png">
We will account for these non-linear relationships in our model using polynomial transformations.

For Health/Life Expectancy, I tested its transformation to the power of 2, 3, and 4:

<img width="319" alt="Screen Shot 2019-04-18 at 2 42 46 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44821660/56383625-489bfc80-61e8-11e9-97a8-b4b4f80b80d3.png">
The best fitting line is the degree 2 transformation. Checking the residual distribution proves such transformation is useable.

Repeating the same steps for Perception of Corruption:

<img width="313" alt="Screen Shot 2019-04-18 at 2 47 15 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44821660/56383866-e98ab780-61e8-11e9-9637-548f86c8e189.png">
Although degree 3 seems to be the best fitting line, the residuals for degree 2 show more of a random distribution. I decide to include the degree 2 transformation to include in my model.

## What Does my Model Look Like?

Inclusive of all the interaction terms and variable transformations, my OLS output shows an R<sup>2</sup> 0.86:
<img width="360" alt="Screen Shot 2019-04-18 at 2 50 54 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44821660/56384118-95cc9e00-61e9-11e9-9dce-099da1cbbf16.png">

This is a slight improvement from my baseline model. However, there are insignificant p-values present as well as some counterintuitive coefficients for my variables.

## Training my Model

After many iterations of including and dropping different variables, I needed to make a trade-off between generating the highest Adj. R<sup>2</sup> and generating reasonable coefficients. Hence, I dropped all variables with p-values > 0.05, variables where the coefficients were not explanatory, and those that are already included in the model as part of an interaction term (these include Generosity, Negative Emotions, Social Support, Perception of Corruption, Positive EMotions, Health/Life expectancy to the second degree, and Perception of Corruption to the second degree.

The final model yielded an R<sup>2</sup> of 0.84 and an Adj. R<sup>2</sup> of 0.83:

## Interpreting the Model

In my multiple-regression model, ~83.7% of the variability in the Happiness Score can be explained by the following variables:
- For every 1 point increase in the score of GDP per Capita, Happiness Score goes up by 0.65
- For every 1 point increase in the score of Health and Life Expectancy, Happiness Score goes down by 4.36 (This inverse relationship could be due to increased financial pressure for retirement given longer expected life. Typically longer life expectancy is observed in developed countries with stronger economies, where, on average, employments are more competitive.)
- For every 1 point increase in the score of Freedom, Happiness Score goes up by 2.52
- For every 1 point increase in the score of Government Confidence, Happiness Score goes down by 1.20 (This seems counterintuitive and would be further research to comprehend)
The could be explained by is this because when people have higher confidence in their government, they tend to expect more from their governments and hence are disappointed purely from higher expectations?)
- Health and Life Expectancy in high Social Support environments increases Happiness Score by 5.01 than that in low Social Support environments
- Perception of Corruption in high Social Support environments lowers Happiness Score by 3.64 than that in low Social Support environments (A possible explanation for this could be related to managing expectations. People in low social support countries tend to perceive their governments as more corrupt, and vice versa. It could be that their low expectations and general distrust in the government prevented as dramatic of a decrease in their happiness compared to those in high social support environments)

### Validating my Model

Since I do not have 2019 data, I cannot make predictions to approximate future happiness. However, I still wanted to test if my model is robust.

Using the same variables from 2017 and 2016, I used my model for each year to see the Actual Happiness Score and the "Predicted Happiness Score" for each country. Then, I plotted out the Margin of Error between the Actual Happiness Scores and the model outputs. (Note that negative MOE indicates that I "underpredicted" the Happiness Score, where as positive MOE indicates that I "overpredicted" the Happiness Score):

<img width="812" alt="Screen Shot 2019-04-18 at 3 23 26 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44821660/56385728-f52cad00-61ed-11e9-94ec-e279679fab96.png">

An interesting observation here is that countries with the least political stability, weakest economy, lowest level of development and tend to have the highest positive MOE. Whereas more developed countries tend to exhibit less variability in their Happiness Scores over 2016-2018.
